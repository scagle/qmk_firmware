# features/
All features that are conditionally included reside here. Includes are compiled, but should clean all references to themselves up if associated feature is not enabled.

## What is this and who the heck thought this was a good idea?!
Well...  It's probably not orthodox. 
But I'm trying to keep all conditional code in one separate directory. 
I don't know if this approach has many advantages/disadvantages, but 
at least it makes it very explicit what is optional and what is not.

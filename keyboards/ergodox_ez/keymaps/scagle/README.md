# "scagle" Configuration
This is my layout created to both practice sustainable firmware development, and to toy with my daily driver keyboard.
I could probably get by with the [[https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/|Oryx/Ergodox online configurators]], but that's just not as fun!

# Layers
    1. BIOS: to act as a BIOS navigator to my keyboard layouts, and as a literal navigator of my computer BIOS.
    2. QWERTY: basic QWERTY layout
    3. SYMBOLS: generic layer devoted to easy-to-reach symbols
    4. ART1: base right-handed digital art layer, with custom keys tailored towards painting tools
    5. ART2: right-handed digital art layer, with custom keys tailored towards layer/menu navigation
    6. EXTRA: generic function keys + numpad
    7. UI: user interface, with audio, mouse, rgb, and EEPROM flashing controls
